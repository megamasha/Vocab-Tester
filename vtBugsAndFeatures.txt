Vocab Tester:

:-) Save to given filename
:-) Load from main menu
:-) Add entries
:-) Hints!
:-) continue testing from options menu
:-) Fix saving of actual null values
:-) calculate score
:-) look into .csv file loading
:-) validate filenames
:-) Ask about saving on exit
:-) Can list selection be done with a switch and ranges? No it can't (not in C anyway).
:-) Save to most recently opened database
:-) Find and edit (including delete) entries from the database manager

Potential improvements:

    getc returns int, but return value is stored as char, leading to potential EOF error. Fix.
    vocabfuzzysearch is case sensitive
    Test is currently (by design) case sensitive. An option could be added to make it case insensitive
    scanf, as used in vocabfuzzysearch is hideously unstable, and can cause unexpected results or crashes if a letter or other unexpected input is entered. Could be replaced with proper validation function.
    Can the separate while loops at lines 648 and 654 be combined using 'substringlength++'?
    if the default and most recently loaded databases are the same, the user is effectively asked the same thing twice

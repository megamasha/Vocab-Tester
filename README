Well hello there!

I'm an autodidact. I am teaching myself programming. First C, then C++, Java and possibly Python (who knows where I'll go from there...)

I also speak a few (real-life, spoken) languages, and like to learn and brush up on my vocab from time to time. This project is a way for me to acheive both.
